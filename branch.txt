1. to create a branch, its easy to create a branch by clicking on branch option in github
1. git pull in vs code for saving changes, now we have two branches.
2. to check the number of branches we have , type "git branch -a "
3. to switch into another branch, type " git checkout branch_name "

now lets create a folder and write code files and push it to the new branch that we have created
git add . -> git commit -m -> git push origin branch_name


now we are gonna merge the sub branch with main branch:
1. type "git merge subbranch_name"
2. then push it by "git push origin main"
thats it yaay!

the new branch aka subbranch will be visible only when we checkout to it.
why do we actually need a subbranch? so individuals can work their code out in sub branch and they all merge it with main branch in the end.
